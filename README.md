# Anchor Episodes Index
## WordPress plugin
###### Available on the wordpress.org plugin repository

This started off with an article I wrote [here](https://jeswebdevelopment.com/add-an-episode-index-to-the-anchor-podcasts-embed-player/) explaining how to make an episode index to the anchor.fm podcast player embed, as this is something that is lacking in the standard player. 

Due to the popularity of that article, I made an embed maker, which you can see [here](https://anchor-embed.jeswebdevelopment.com/) and a WordPress plugin, which is the repository you are looking at now. 

Email me [here](mailto:jesse@jesweb.dev) for suggestions and feedback.

## Usage

Firstly, download the zip file here and install and activate Anchor Episodes Index (this plugin) in your WordPress dashboard.

Once activated, go to the settings and fill out the Anchor Site URL and Anchor RSS URL fields. 

Then copy the shortcode you'll see on the settings page and paste it in any page or post.
