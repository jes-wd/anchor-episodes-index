A lightweight plugin that allows you to output an anchor.fm podcast player on your site that includes an episode index. Just add two URL's on the settings page, grab the shortcode, and you're good to go!

== Description ==

This plugin appends an episode index to the anchor.fm podcast player. Currently, the only available embed for the anchor.fm player is for a single episode. 
This plugin allows you to add your entire episode index, just the same as you have on your anchor.fm site. 
Simply input your site and RSS URL's on the settings page and add the shortcode to any page or post. 

*** FOR WORDPRESS.ORG REVIEWERS ***
Please use these URL's on the settings page to test the functionality of the plugin:
Anchor Site URL: https://anchor.fm/menschliche-welt
Anchor RSS URL: https://anchor.fm/s/1027aba4/podcast/rss
